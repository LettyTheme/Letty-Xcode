# Letty-Xcode

Letty is a set of matching pastel light and dark themes designed in tandem to be relaxing and easy on the eyes in any environment, while maintaining a touch of fun. Letty was loosely inspired by the Nord theme with its pastel colours and cold feel.

As of now, the Xcode themes are the reference implementation of the Letty themes.

- Letty Snow: Bright white light theme
- Letty Sky: Light theme with a violet-tinted background
- Letty Aurora: Medium dark theme with a violet-tinted background
- Letty Moon: Really dark theme for late-night coding
